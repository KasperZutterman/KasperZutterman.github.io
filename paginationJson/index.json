I challenge you to think of one application on\nthe Web that would not benefit from being able to determine similarities between\nbits of information. Detection of duplicate documents is becoming increasingly\nimportant for businesses and data scientist. Near-duplicate pages found on the\nWeb could be plagiarisms, or they could be mirrors with identical information\nbut released on different outlets. \n\nIn this article we'll explore a range of techniques and algorithms to determine\nthe similarity between items. We will also explain the how and the why, and have\na look at some use cases.\n\nHow can we define similarity?\nWe can define similarity as a measure of how much  2 sets, collections or\ndocument have in common when we compare them. The more resemblance the 2\ndocuments have to each other, the higher their similarity. To make this\ndefinition resemble a concrete value, we will introduce the Jaccard similarity.\n\nJaccard similarity\nThe notion of how similar sets are is called \"Jaccard similarity\n[/programmatically-calculate-similarities/[Jaccard%20similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index]\n\". The Jaccard similarity of two sets, A and B, can be calculated by the ratio\nof their intersection size divided by their union size. We shall denote the\nJaccard similarity of A and B by:\n\nJ(A,B) = |A ∩ B| / |A ∪ B|\n\nUsing the above formula, we are able to calculate the exact similarity of 2\nsets. To make this easy method transferable to other sources of information, we\nneed techniques to represent these sources of data as sets.\n\nFor example:\n\nJ(A,B) = |A ∩ B| / |A ∪ B| = |2| / |6 + 4 -2| = 2 / 8 = 0.25\n\nTwo sets with Jaccard similarity 2/8Jaccard distance\nThe Jaccard similarity is a measure of how close sets are, albeit not really a\ndistance measure. To calculate the distance between two sets utilising the\nJaccard similarity calculation, we simply take 1 minus the calculated Jaccard\nsimilarity. This is called the Jaccard distance, the closer two sets, the higher\nthe Jaccard similarity and thus the lower the Jaccard distance.\n\ndJ (A,B) = 1 - J(A,B)\n\nHow to shingle documents\nThe best performing way to represent a document as a set, for the purpose of\nfinding lexical matches, is to construct a set containing short strings of text\nthat appear within the document. By doing so, same pieces of text will always be\nidentified regardless of their position. \n\nk-Shingling\nA common shingling technique to represent documents as sets  is k-shingling. As\na document can simply be seen as a string of characters, we can define a\nk-shingle of this document as all possible consecutive k length substrings\nexisting in the document. Here you can see an example of a k=2 shingle:\n\nOriginal: \"Thank you for reading this blog\"\n\nk=2 shingled: \"Thank you\" \"you for\" \"for reading\" \"reading this\" \"this blog\"\n\nShingle size\nChoosing the best shingle size can be a daunting task, if you take your shingle\nsize to large, you won't be able to find similarities between documents, only if\nthey are a near perfect match. If you take your shingle size to small, as an\nextreme example k = 1, you will have a bias because the top 1000 most frequently\nused words represent around 85% of all word usage. All common used characters\nwill be shared between most of the documents you will want to compare.\n\nTo avoid a bias towards too little or too much abstraction, you should pick your\nk size large enough that the probability of any given shingle appearing in any\ngiven document is low.\n\nYou could also decide to shingle on characters in favor of words, this way you\ncould have a representation that is less defined by words but more by the order\nof words following each other.\n\nShingle hashing\nInstead of using using string representations as shingles directly, you should\nfavor the use of a hash function to determine a hash representing the shingle.\nThis can lead to memory-usage reduction and faster comparison speeds. To select\nthe best string hashing function, please have a look at this overview\n[http://www.cse.yorku.ca/~oz/hash.html] by Ozan Yigit.\n\nUse cases\nDetecting Plagiarism: \nDetecting plagiarised content relies on our ability to find textual similarities\nbetween content. Plagiarized documents may only contain some parts of the\noriginal piece mixed in and scrambled up between his own content, or content\nfrom even more sources. Determining whether documents are plagiarized can be a\ndaunting task because a character by character comparison won't always yield\ncorrect results.\n\nSame Source Articles\nWhen using news aggregators, such as Google News, you are able to find multiple\nsources and news outlets reporting about the same event. Aggregators are able to\ncluster articles about the same topic using similarity scores. Reporter also\npublish articles through the Associated Press, which can then be redistributed\nby other websites.\n\nConclusions\n * Jaccard Similarity: The Jaccard similarity coefficient is a statistic used to\n   measure the similarity between sets. It is calculated by the ratio of the\n   size of the intersection to the size of the union.\n * Jaccard Distance: The Jaccard distance is a distance measure between sets,\n   calculated as one minus the Jaccard Similarity\n * Shingling: A way of representing text documents as a set of strings. By\n   representing a document by its set of k-shingles, we form a set of k long\n   characters that consecutively appear in the document. By calculating the\n   Jaccard similarity of shingled sets, we are able to measure the textual\n   similarity of  documents.\n\nResources\n * Mining Massive Datasets Chapter 3 - Anand Rajaraman\n   [http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/mmds/ch3.pdf]\n * Introduction to Information Retrieval - Christopher D.
